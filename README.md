### Project Description
Build a Python application that takes a dataset of smartphones and ranks their features (like battery, camera, price, etc.) based on user requests. The app should be able to classify smartphones (e.g., into budget, mid-range, flagship) and rank features according to their importance or user-defined criteria.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Data Collection
- Gather smartphone data (CSV, Excel, or web scraping).
- Features: RAM, Storage, Battery, Camera, Processor, Display, Price, etc.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Use pandas to clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize/standardize features).

#### 3. Feature Selection & Ranking
- Use statistical methods (correlation, mutual information) or ML-based feature importance (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to rank features.
- Optionally, allow users to assign weights to features.

#### 4. Classification
- Train classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) to categorize smartphones based on features.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.

#### 5. User Interaction
- Accept user preferences (e.g., prioritize battery life over camera).
- Use these preferences to adjust feature rankings.

#### 6. Result Display
- Output ranked features and/or ranked list of smartphones matching user criteria.
- Optionally, visualize results using plots (bar charts, heatmaps).
